ver0.19 2020-04-21
code improvements to the start-of-turn sequence. You can
now view an enemy's attackable tiles by selecting them.

ver0.18 2020-04-18
Banners now fly around to mark the start of someone's
turn. Improved spritefont to also right and center justify
to a point.

ver0.17 2020-04-10
Added some polish (AKA make myself seem productive when
I'm actually not). Enemy phase music is here though

ver0.16 2020-04-06
Fixed a bug where units would sometimes not gray out when
ending turn. Also, disallowed attacking your own units.

ver0.15 2020-04-05
When an enemy unit attacks, show who they attack. Also, 
disabled the fps label (can show by pressing 'X').

ver0.14 2020-04-04
Added turns (although no turn transitions just yet) as well
as a naive version of alliances that I'll improve later.
It would appear that I now have to rethink my pathfinding
to treat enemy units as walls.

ver0.13 2020-03-19
Reworked the battle engine for moving units. covid-19 bad.

ver0.12 2020-03-09
Updated the battle engine to use separate weapon sprites.
Also, fixed some outdated music issues. I'm having trouble
thinking of a good way to have custom animations for any
weapon type, so expect more battle engine changes.

ver0.11 2020-03-07
Reworked some mechanics of the battle scene. However,
those changes are not yet visible. Added art to make
it look like I did something more interesting. Also,
you can press "X" to hide the FPS panel.

ver0.10 2020-03-07
Improved how tiles look (for attackable/movable tiles).
Implemented a battle scene, although it's fairly boring
right now.

ver0.9 2020-03-03
Added attackable tiles (with the assumption that every unit
has 1 and 3 range, but not 2. Weird, huh?). I'm trying to
procrastinate on implementing battle scenes, but it seems
quite inevitable at this point.

ver0.8 2020-03-02
Units can move and select from (a limited) pool of actions.
Unfortunately, only wait works, as attack is unimplemented
(apart from a console.log) and will be a lot of work.

ver0.7 2020-02-23
sound effects added. (Except regular beep happens every
time you move the cursor, so I ended up not playing it).
Also, Old Sounding Song is back.

ver0.6 2020-02-23
When making a unit move, the camera will go back to follow
the unit (however, the game is softlocked after doing so).
Also fixed a sneaky movetile generation bug.

2020-02-22 @ 22:27
Vastly improved camera movement when cancelling unit move.
(Allowed for independent camera movement).

2020-02-22 @ 19:21
pressing 'x' no longer does anything (yay). Now, you can
ctrl-shift-i and type console.exe("colorunit unitID r g b") 
to recolor a unit. (unitID is an int from 0-9 inclusive.
r, g, b are ints, but only make sense from 0-255.)
You can also type console.exe("colorunit unitID random").

2020-02-21 @ 17:41
finished unit pathfinding/movement. (other than treat enemies as walls, but we'll cross that bridge another day.)

2020-02-20 @ 22:21:
implemented pathfinding for unit move. Will bug test.

2020-02-17 @ 21:27:
implemented (partially) unit move.

2020-02-17 @ 17:25:
improved time complexity of coordinate lookup used in various places.

2020-02-17 @ 15:48:
further changed cursor interaction upon cancelling. Additionally, allowed the cursor to "pause" by pressing the "x" key. Will remove later.
