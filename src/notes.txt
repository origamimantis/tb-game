ver0.11 2020-03-07
Reworked some mechanics of the battle scene. However,
those changes are not yet visible. Added art to make
it look like I did something more interesting. Also,
you can press "X" to hide the FPS panel.

ver0.10 2020-03-07
Improved how tiles look (for attackable/movable tiles).
Implemented a battle scene, although it's fairly boring
right now.

ver0.9 2020-03-03
Added attackable tiles (with the assumption that every unit
has 1 and 3 range, but not 2. Weird, huh?). I'm trying to
procrastinate on implementing battle scenes, but it seems
quite inevitable at this point.

ver0.8 2020-03-02
Units can move and select from (a limited) pool of actions.
Unfortunately, only wait works, as attack is unimplemented
(apart from a console.log) and will be a lot of work.

ver0.7 2020-02-23
sound effects added. (Except regular beep happens every
time you move the cursor, so I ended up not playing it).
Also, Old Sounding Song is back.

ver0.6 2020-02-23
When making a unit move, the camera will go back to follow
the unit (however, the game is softlocked after doing so).
Also fixed a sneaky movetile generation bug.

Vastly improved camera movement when cancelling unit move.
(Allowed for independent camera movement).

pressing 'x' no longer does anything (yay). Now, you can
ctrl-shift-i and type console.exe("colorunit unitID r g b") 
to recolor a unit. (unitID is an int from 0-9 inclusive.
r, g, b are ints, but only make sense from 0-255.)
You can also type console.exe("colorunit unitID random").

finished unit pathfinding/movement. (other than treat enemies as walls, but we'll cross that bridge another day.)

2020-02-20 @ 22:21:
implemented pathfinding for unit move. Will bug test.

2020-02-17 @ 21:27:
implemented (partially) unit move.

2020-02-17 @ 17:25:
improved time complexity of coordinate lookup used in various places.

2020-02-17 @ 15:48:
further changed cursor interaction upon cancelling. Additionally, allowed the cursor to "pause" by pressing the "x" key. Will remove later.
