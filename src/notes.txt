ver0.34 2020-08-24
Options menu is up. There's only one setting right now that
shows the tile movement costs for units when enabled.

ver0.33 2020-08-11
Bandages are now useable! they restore up to 10 health when
used. They also have infinite uses (for now).

ver0.32 2020-07-12
Trade menu is fully functional!!
Use select (".") to select things to trade, and
use info (";") to toggle between trading weapons and items.

ver0.31 2020-06-25
switched to a different sound library. Trade menu is up,
but doesn't do anything.

ver0.30 2020-06-19
Different weapons are now equippable when entering combat.

ver0.29 2020-06-18
More unit profile screen progress. The "info" key
was changed to semicolon.

ver0.28 2020-06-15
In-progress work on unit profile screen. To see it,
press slash when the cursor is over a unit.

ver0.27 2020-06-14
Hit and crit rates, damage calculation, better battle
engine!

ver0.26 2020-06-09
Implemented a better sprite font system (except now it's
an actual embedded font). Fixed a music looping issue for
tracks with an intro.

ver0.25 2020-06-04
some battle sound effects have been updated. No actual
progress, though.

ver0.24 2020-05-28
Map and menu sound effects have been added.

ver0.23 2020-05-25
Added info panels out of battle to show unit details.
Also, units have names now!

ver0.22 2020-05-24
Units can now be killed in battle.

ver0.21 2020-05-21
Added day/night cycle and cleaned up some code.
Additionally, updated menus for clearer selection.

ver0.20 2020-04-23
Units are now unable to walk through enemy units.

ver0.19 2020-04-21
code improvements to the start-of-turn sequence. You can
now view an enemy's attackable tiles by selecting them.

ver0.18 2020-04-18
Banners now fly around to mark the start of someone's
turn. Improved spritefont to also right and center justify
to a point.

ver0.17 2020-04-10
Added some polish (AKA make myself seem productive when
I'm actually not). Enemy phase music is here though

ver0.16 2020-04-06
Fixed a bug where units would sometimes not gray out when
ending turn. Also, disallowed attacking your own units.

ver0.15 2020-04-05
When an enemy unit attacks, show who they attack. Also, 
disabled the fps label (can show by pressing 'X').

ver0.14 2020-04-04
Added turns (although no turn transitions just yet) as well
as a naive version of alliances that I'll improve later.
It would appear that I now have to rethink my pathfinding
to treat enemy units as walls.

ver0.13 2020-03-19
Reworked the battle engine for moving units. covid-19 bad.

ver0.12 2020-03-09
Updated the battle engine to use separate weapon sprites.
Also, fixed some outdated music issues. I'm having trouble
thinking of a good way to have custom animations for any
weapon type, so expect more battle engine changes.

ver0.11 2020-03-07
Reworked some mechanics of the battle scene. However,
those changes are not yet visible. Added art to make
it look like I did something more interesting. Also,
you can press "X" to hide the FPS panel.

ver0.10 2020-03-07
Improved how tiles look (for attackable/movable tiles).
Implemented a battle scene, although it's fairly boring
right now.

ver0.9 2020-03-03
Added attackable tiles (with the assumption that every unit
has 1 and 3 range, but not 2. Weird, huh?). I'm trying to
procrastinate on implementing battle scenes, but it seems
quite inevitable at this point.

ver0.8 2020-03-02
Units can move and select from (a limited) pool of actions.
Unfortunately, only wait works, as attack is unimplemented
(apart from a console.log) and will be a lot of work.

ver0.7 2020-02-23
sound effects added. (Except regular beep happens every
time you move the cursor, so I ended up not playing it).
Also, Old Sounding Song is back.

ver0.6 2020-02-23
When making a unit move, the camera will go back to follow
the unit (however, the game is softlocked after doing so).
Also fixed a sneaky movetile generation bug.

2020-02-22 @ 22:27
Vastly improved camera movement when cancelling unit move.
(Allowed for independent camera movement).

2020-02-22 @ 19:21
pressing 'x' no longer does anything (yay). Now, you can
ctrl-shift-i and type console.exe("colorunit unitID r g b") 
to recolor a unit. (unitID is an int from 0-9 inclusive.
r, g, b are ints, but only make sense from 0-255.)
You can also type console.exe("colorunit unitID random").

2020-02-21 @ 17:41
finished unit pathfinding/movement. (other than treat enemies as walls, but we'll cross that bridge another day.)

2020-02-20 @ 22:21:
implemented pathfinding for unit move. Will bug test.

2020-02-17 @ 21:27:
implemented (partially) unit move.

2020-02-17 @ 17:25:
improved time complexity of coordinate lookup used in various places.

2020-02-17 @ 15:48:
further changed cursor interaction upon cancelling. Additionally, allowed the cursor to "pause" by pressing the "x" key. Will remove later.
